# Shared source package

This package contains the Agency app, local database schema, agent skill, approval and layout defaults, setup scripts. It starts with an empty database.

The README screenshots and preview pages use fictional examples. They are labeled as samples and contain no customer work.

Personal profiles, cards, feedback, customer messages, credentials, browser state and generated media are not part of this package. Those files stay in the user's local environment and are Git-ignored. The standalone writing skill is optional and is not bundled.

The coding agent reads the skill and relevant authorized context, prepares drafts or concrete ideas, and carries out the action the user approves. The app stores cards and jobs locally; it does not synchronize accounts, credentials, cards, or schedules through Git. `npm run agency:claude` launches the user's existing local Claude Code installation and does not use an LLM API.
